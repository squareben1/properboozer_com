      "<p>Side scrolling platform game in which the level is procedurally generated based on user-uploaded audio files. Upload your favourite song and give it a go! </p> <p>Rather than use an existing library like p5.js, the game mechanics were built exclusively with vanilla JavaScript. This was a big challenge but taught me a huge amount about what goes into creating a game.</p> <p>It is built as a single page Rails application. I learned the basics of responsive design on this project. Thereâ€™s also a separate set of gesture controls for mobile.</p>",
